It can forward simulate the metamorphic or magmatic system, to predict the stable mineral assemblages, compositions and various physical and chemical properties of given P-T conditions. Phase equilibrium modeling also has been a very important method to determine the metamorphic P-T condition and evolution path of rocks.</p>\n<p>  GeoPS is a free, open source, visual phase equilibrium simulating software, which based on Gibbs free energy minimum method.</p>\n<h1>How Fast?</h1>\n<p>  Well-designed architecture and data structures, efficient algorithms make exceptional computing efficiency. It need only a few minutes to completed a complex phase diagram. To quantitate the speed, the following table compares the performance of three different soft in same test platform.</p>\n<p>  Test platform：Dell XPS-15 Laptop，CPU i7-6700HQ 2.6GHz, 16G RAM， Windows10 ×64 Home</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align:left\"><div style=\"width: 60pt\"> Fig.</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:left\"><div style=\"width: 60pt\"> GeoPS   <br> 1 thread</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:center\"><div style=\"width: 60pt\"> GeoPS   <br> 4 threads</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:center\">Perple_X <br> v6.8.6</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:center\">Domino</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:center\">Note</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">BL487 <br> Green 2016 Fig.9</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">8m30s; <Br>Pre:&lt;1m</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">3m25s <Br> Pre：&lt;30s</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">~17h</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">2h57m</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">In Perple_X, initial_resolution=[1/8 1/16], the rest of options are default.<br><a href=\"./rst/bl487.html\">See results</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">White 2014 Fig.9a</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">20m05s; <Br>Pre:&lt;1m</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">5m1s <Br> Pre：&lt;30s</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">1h23m</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">1h31m22.34s</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">In Perple_X, initial_resolution=[1/10 1/20], the rest of options are default.<br><a href=\"./rst/W14f9a.html\">See results</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">KLB-1 <br>J&amp;H 2015 Fig.1</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">8m1s; <Br>Pre:&lt;1m</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">1m51s <Br> Pre：&lt;20s</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\"></td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\"></td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">BL487 <br> Without solutions</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">22s; <Br>Pre:3s</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">20s <Br> Pre：&lt;3s</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">2s</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\"></td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Perple_X default options。<br><a href=\"./RST/bl487_No_Sol.html\">See results</a></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<pre><code>  Pre: Preliminary result；\n  For Perple_X and Theriak-Domino, the time is only computation time, not include creating diagram；The time of GeoPS include computing and drawing.\n  Theriak-Domino, using the version of D.K.

So the initial_resolution was reduced.\n</code></pre>\n<h1>Reliability Of Results</h1>\n<p>  In order to demonstrate the reliability of GeoPS, we recalculated several phase diagrams of various rock types which are generated by THERMOCALC in published articles.  The results are consistent with that calculated by THERMOCALC, while using the same thermodynamic dataset and Solution models.</p>\n<h2>P-T pseudosections of metapelites in NCFMASOCR system</h2>\n<p>  The left figure is the Fig.9 in White et al., 2014 JMG which is calculated by Thermocalc. The right one is calculated by GeoPS with the same dataset and a-x models with that of this paper.\n<img src=\"/img/Help/W2014MnF9.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2>P-T pseduosections of ultrabasic rocks in NCFMASOCR system</h2>\n<p>  The left one is the Fig.1 of Jennings and Holland 2015 which is calculated by Thermocalc. The right one is calculated by GeoPS with the same dataset and a-x models of this paper.\n<img src=\"/img/Help/KLB-JH2015c.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2>P-T pseudosections of metamafic rocks in MNNCKFMASHTO system</h2>\n<p>  The left figure is the Fig.6 in Green et al., 2016 JMG which is calculated by Thermocalc. The right one is calculated by GeoPS.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/Help/BL487.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h1>Sufficiently Low Costs Of Learning And Using</h1>\n<p>  Even without experiences of phase equilibrium modelling, the user also can easily use GeoPS to implement a phase equilibrium computing in a few minutes. It is very easy to obtain the software. It can be directly opened or installed from this website home page. After input of bulk composition, the phase diagram calculation can be completed automatically with one click. And the preliminary results during the calculation process will also be displayed on the main interface in time.\n<img src=\"/img/Help/GeoPS_Demo.gif\" alt=\"\"></p>\n",
