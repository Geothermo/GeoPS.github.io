Among them:\n\n    ID is sequence number, starting from 0;\n\n    Name is required;\n\n    Index is not required, the system will search automatically according to the dataset.\n\n    Endmake is the making formula of endmenber, which is composed of the coefficient and name of endmenbers. It supports addition and subtraction of multiple endmenbers, as shown in the following figure.\n\n    min and Max is the range of endmenber (optional).\n\n    DH, DS and DV are the DQF values of the endmenbers, and alpha is the van Laar parameter in the asymmetric model.\n</code></pre>\n<p><img src=\"/img/Help/solutionModel.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Edit the ion occupation information in the Site tab.\n<img src=\"/img/Help/solutionModel2.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Edit the Interaction energy information in the Interaction energy tab.\n<img src=\"/img/Help/solutionModel3.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>After editing, click the &quot;Apply&quot; button to confirm the edit.
