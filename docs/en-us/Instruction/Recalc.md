# Local area recalculation



&emsp; If some area of a calculated phase diagram is chaotic or the boundary is irregular, you can press and hold the right mouse button, select this area, then, the software will recalculate the nodes in selected area. After calculation, the phase diagram can be redrawn through the menu "calculation" --> "redraw".  Do not select too large area. If not, it will be slow.
