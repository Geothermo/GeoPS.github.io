# What is GeoPS?

&emsp; Thermodynamic phase equilibrium modeling paves the way toward a quantitative understanding of geological processes such as metamorphism and magmatism. It can forward simulate the metamorphic or magmatic system, to predict the stable mineral assemblages, compositions and various physical and chemical properties of given P-T conditions. Phase equilibrium modeling also has been a very important method to determine the metamorphic P-T condition and evolution path of rocks.

&emsp; GeoPS is a free visual phase equilibrium simulating software, which based on Gibbs free energy minimum method. 

&emsp; It provides a wide range of phase equilibria calculations and illustration facilities, include calculation various type of phase diagrams (P-T, P-X, T-X, X-X), isopleths, and thermodynamic modelling for path-dependent open system processes. And more functions are being developed.

&emsp; What you see is what you get. The friendly GUI and no cost of learning make thermodynamic modelling accessible to any researchers and students of earth sciences. 

&emsp; Super-high efficiency makes you can get the results while you wait, even for modelling of a complex system.

# How Fast?

&emsp; Well-designed architecture and data structures, efficient algorithms make exceptional computing efficiency. It need only a few minutes to completed a complex phase diagram. To quantitate the speed, the following table compares the performance of three different soft in same test platform. 

&emsp; Test platform：

&emsp;&emsp; A: Dell XPS-15 Laptop，CPU i7-6700HQ 2.6GHz, 16G RAM， Windows10 ×64 Home

&emsp;&emsp; B: Lenovo ThinkCentre M8300 Desktop，CPU i7-2600 @3,4Hz, 16G RAM， Windows10 pro ×64

	  a：computer A；
	  b： computer B；
	  Pre: Preliminary result；
	  For Perple_X and Theriak-Domino, the time is only computation time, not include creating diagram；The time of GeoPS include computing and drawing.
	  Theriak-Domino, using the version of D.K. Tinkham，from： http://dtinkham.net/peq.html 
	  Perple_X v6.8.6， from official website：http://www.perplex.ethz.ch/。The newest version seems to be slower, so v6.8.6 was used. 
	  For Perple_X, if using the default setting, it will prompt “**error ver041** too many pseudocompounds, routine: SUBDIV”. So the initial_resolution was reduced.


# Reliability Of Results

&emsp; In order to demonstrate the reliability of GeoPS, we recalculated several phase diagrams of various rock types which are generated by THERMOCALC in published articles.  The results are consistent with that calculated by THERMOCALC, while using the same thermodynamic dataset and Solution models.

## P-T pseudosections of metapelites in NCFMASOCR system

&emsp; The left figure is the Fig.9 in White et al., 2014 JMG which is calculated by Thermocalc. The right one is calculated by GeoPS with the same dataset and a-x models with that of this paper.

&emsp; The left one is the Fig.1 of Jennings and Holland 2015 which is calculated by Thermocalc. The right one is calculated by GeoPS with the same dataset and a-x models of this paper.

# No Costs Of Learning
&emsp; User can easily use GeoPS to implement a phase equilibrium computing in a few minutes，even has no experiences of phase equilibrium modelling. It is very easy to obtain the software. It can be directly opened or installed from this website home page. After input of bulk composition, the phase diagram calculation can be completed automatically with one click. And the preliminary results during the calculation process will be displayed on the main interface in time.
